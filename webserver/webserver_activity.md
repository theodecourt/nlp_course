# Webserver construction activity

Check `app.py`. It is the code for a minimalist webserver in Flask. 

## 1 - Analysis

Find the answers to the questions below, according to your analysis:

1. What class implements a dummy predictor?
2. How is an instance of a predictor connected to the app?
3. What is the name of this design pattern?

## 2 - Construction

1. Make a predictor in Sklearn for your favourite classification theme. Save your model.
1. Change the code so that it loads your model instead of the dummy model. Test it!
1. Add a property `reason` to the output that yields some insight on the underlying reasons of each prediction (ex: a list of words that indicate it)
