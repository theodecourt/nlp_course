    "# TEST 1: Leveraging LLMs for Feature Generation and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if our data has $N$ features, we need around $10N$ data items to reach peak performance with classic classifiers like Logistic Regression. Therefore, if our vocabulary has 10,000 words, we would need around 1 million items in the training set to reach peak performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting idea regarding this was explored in 2024 in [Balek, V., S'ykora, L., Sklen'ak, V., & Kliegr, T. (2024). LLM-based feature generation from text for interpretable machine learning. ArXiv, abs/2409.07132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07132). The idea is to use an LLM to generate meaningful and interpretable features from text, and then use Logistic Regression for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the movie plots dataset, we could have features like:\n",
    "- \"Is the protagonist an animal?\" (0 or 1)\n",
    "- \"Does the plot indicate psychological suffering?\" (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a reasonable number of these features, our model could make predictions based on meaningful features instead of raw words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Perform feature extraction for a particular dataset\n",
    "* Compare performance and explainability of classifiers with different approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "I highlight a few elements of our usual rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use AI to generate any code you are asked to make yourself. This includes ChatGPT, CoPilot and all similar generators.\n",
    "* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use Google or any other search engine.\n",
    "* You are **ALLOWED** to use the offical documentations for libraries: \n",
    "    * [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)\n",
    "    * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n",
    "    * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "    * [google AI studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)\n",
    "* You are **ALLOWED** to use previous code from this course as basis.\n",
    "* You **MUST** use the university's proctoring software to show you are complying with these rules\n",
    "* This task is **INDIVIDUAL**. DO NOT share your code or results with anyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks and Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "* At any point, refer to [Balek et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07132). \n",
    "* Make a well-commented code to solve each one of the tasks below.\n",
    "* Each task will be evaluated as:\n",
    "    * Insufficient: task is not done, off-topic, or low-effort\n",
    "    * In process: task is incomplete, done with a clear conceptual error, or comments \n",
    "    * Proficient: everything works and comments are enough to understand what is being done\n",
    "    * Advanced: everything works, comments are enough to understand what is being done, and code is well organized and formated using functions, dataclasses, and other adequate structures.\n",
    "* This task should be finished by the end of the class.\n",
    "* After you are finished, submit the executed notebook in our LMS system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Preparation:\n",
    "Adapting Balek et al.'s strategy to our movie plot classification case, create a dataset with at least 100 labeled items and at least 5 meaningful features. None of the features can be the class itself (\"is this a drama plot?\"). Use a clear strategy to avoid exceeding free tier quotas. Store data locally in a format of your choice.\n",

Arriving home one afternoon in a wine besotted condition, he is indeed a terrifying spectacle to his little family. Later, after he has slept off the effects to some extent, while at supper, the little girl shows him two tickets for the theater, begging him to take her. After some persuasion he consents to go. The play is a dramatization of Émile Zola's L'Assommoir, which shows how short a journey it is from peace and happiness to woe and despair by the road of rum. At the final curtain of the play, he is a changed man, going homeward with a firm determination that he will drink no more, which he promises his wife upon his return. Two years later we find the little family seated, happy and peaceful, at the fireside and we know that the promise has been kept. \n",

      "The novel is set in the reign of \"old King Henry VI\" (1422–1461, 1470–1471) and during the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). The story begins with the Tunstall Moat House alarm bell, rung to summon recruits for its absent lord Sir Daniel Brackley, to join the Battle of Risingham; at which the outlaw \"fellowship\" known as \"the Black Arrow\" begins to strike with its \"four black arrows\" for the \"four black hearts\" of Brackley and three of his retainers: Nicholas Appleyard, Bennet Hatch, and Sir Oliver Oates, the parson. The rhyme posted in explanation of this attack, makes the protagonist Richard ('Dick') Shelton, ward of Sir Daniel, curious about the death of his father Sir Harry Shelton. Having been dispatched to Kettley, where Sir Daniel was quartered, and sent to Tunstall Moat House by return dispatch, he falls in with a fugitive, Joanna Sedley, disguised as a boy with the alias of John Matcham: an heiress kidnapped by Sir Daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over Richard by marrying her to him.\n",
      "As they travel through Tunstall Forest, Joanna tries to persuade Dick to turn against Sir Daniel in sympathy with the Black Arrow outlaws, whose camp they discover near the ruins of Grimstone manor. The next day they are met in the forest by Sir Daniel himself, disguised as a leper and returning to the Moat House after his side was defeated at Risingham. Dick and Joanna then follow Sir Daniel to the Moat House. Here Dick confirms that Sir Daniel is the murderer of his father, and escapes injured from the Moat House. He is rescued by the outlaws of the Black Arrow.\n",
      "The second half of the novel, Books 3–5, tells how Dick rescues Joanna from Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow fellowship and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback, the future Richard III of England. It centres on Shoreby, where the Lancastrian forces are entrenched. Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of Book 3, wherein Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna. They are unsuccessful, and after Joanna is moved to Sir Daniel's main quarters in Shoreby, Dick visits her in the guise of a Franciscan friar. Stevenson, the populariser of the tales of the Arabian nights, has Dick tell the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves in Book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain Arblaster, whose ship Dick and the outlaws had stolen.\n",
      "While shadowing Sir Daniel, Dick and the outlaws encounter another group of spies interested in Joanna. After a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, Dick finds that he has conquered Joanna's lawful guardian, Lord Foxham, who promises to give Joanna to Dick in marriage after a contemplated seaside rescue. There is irony in Foxham scolding Dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in Dick and Foxham's plans to rescue Joanna. Wounded in the failed seaside rescue, Foxham writes letters of recommendation for Dick to Richard Crookback, whom Dick must find on the outskirts of Shoreby.\n",
      "Richard Crookback, Duke of Gloucester, makes his appearance in Book 5. As Dick is leaving Shoreby he sees Crookback holding his own against seven or eight Lancastrian assailants, and assists his victory. Dick's accurate knowledge of the Lancastrian forces in Shoreby aid Crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day. Dick is also successful as one of Crookback's commanders. Crookback knights Dick on the field of battle and, following their victory, gives him fifty horsemen to pursue Sir Daniel, who has escaped Shoreby with Joanna. Dick succeeds in rescuing Joanna, but loses his men in the process. He, Joanna, and Alicia Risingham travel to Holywood where he and Joanna are married. In this way he keeps his initial pledge to Joanna to convey her safely to Holywood.\n",
      "In the early morning of his wedding day Dick encounters a fugitive Sir Daniel trying to enter Holywood seaport to escape to France or Burgundy. Because it is his wedding day, Dick does not want to soil his hands with Sir Daniel's blood, so he simply bars his way by challenging him either to hand-to-hand combat or alerting a Yorkist perimeter patrol. Sir Daniel retreats, but is shot by Ellis Duckworth (the outlaws' captain) with the last black arrow. Thereafter Sir Richard and Lady Shelton live in Tunstall Moat House untroubled by the rest of the Wars of the Roses. They provide for both Captain Arblaster and the outlaw Will Lawless by pensioning them and settling them in Tunstall hamlet, where Lawless does a volte face by returning to the Franciscan order, taking the name, Brother Honestus. \n",

      "As described in a film magazine,[5] Barbara Norton (La Badie) and her brother Tom (Marlo), orphaned children of a veteran who gave his life for his country, go to live with their uncle Phineas (Howard) and aunt (Hastings) in the city. It is just before the entrance of the United States into the European war and the uncle is a pacifist. He holds meetings at home where Barbara assists him. Barbara's brother is a loyal American and is greatly troubled by the uncle's expectations to count on him. Barbara meets John Alton (Herbert), who wins her promise to be his wife. They are very happy until war is declared and Barbara cannot bear the thought of her future husband not doing service for his country. His \"Peace at Any Price\" button is the last straw and she gives him a choice of either joining the \"colors\" or breaking the engagement. John declares that he is a true pacifist and Barbara, believing that a man who cannot support his country is that country's enemy, breaks the engagement publicly. Her fiance becomes very unpopular at his club because of his views and is taken to task by one of his father's friends. Having lost Barbara and his popularity makes him resent the constant references to the United States and his debt to his country, and he curses his native land. Barbara enlists as a Red Cross nurse and her brother as a soldier. Later, an old friend of John's family, Pop Milton (Dundan), gives him a copy of The Man Without a Country and asks him to read it and rise above his treasonous views. He does so, and as he reads the immortal story the patriotic spirit of Barbara comes to him in a vision of Columbia who tells him that in a previous life he was the Philip Nolan of the story. She takes him back to historic times and shows him a succession of scenes from the book. The man of today sees with horror the famous court martial in which he was sentenced to never hear of the United States again, the tragedy of the careful carrying out of the sentence, and the pitiful death of the man, made easier by the humanity of Captain Danforth (Gilmour), who gives him a brief history of the land he learns to bless before he dies. John's spirit returns from the allegorical journey and he responds to the new and vigorous manhood within and enlists at once, thereby winning Barbara, who was at home on sick leave from her nursing work in France. \n",
