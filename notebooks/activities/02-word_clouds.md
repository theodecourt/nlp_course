# Word Clouds

A wordcloud is a content visualization tool in which the most frequent words from a document are displayed in a cloud. In this cloud, more frequent words are displayed in larger fonts.

There are many libraries to make word clouds, for example:

`pip install wordcloud`

Now, go to your university's library and download some project reports - maybe capstone projects, graduate-level thesis, scientific articles... your call!

Make word cloud visualizations for them.

After that, get some news posts (from, for example, Reuters) about the same topic you have got your scientific articles from. Make their word cloud.

Visualize everything and discuss:

* What is similar in the word clouds between different domains?
* What is different in the word clouds between different domains?
* What do the word clouds reveal?

## Keep going

Repeat the experiment for other different sources - maybe different news sources about the same topic, or different books on the same subject. Does the word cloud enable you to see differences?
